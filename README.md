## 🕹️ About the Arcade

Learning game development often involves re-creating classic games to understand their mechanics or building small projects to focus on specific Pygame techniques. While these projects may not warrant a full repository of their own, they represent essential steps in mastering game development. The **Pygame Arcade** serves as a dedicated space to catalog, demonstrate, and celebrate that progress.
