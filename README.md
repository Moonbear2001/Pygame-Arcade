# pygame_template

This is a Pygame project created to be a container for other pygame projects. The Pygame 
arcade is a nice and extensible way to store and interact with a Pygame portfolio. 

Sometimes while learning game development it is good to recreate classic games in order 
to understand how they work. Or you might complete a smaller project in order to learn a
specific aspect of Pygame. These projects represent important learning but might not 
merit a project unto themselves. The Pygame Arcade is a way to catalog and show off that
learning.
