gaols:

- most efficient way to propogate events around the project?

- ability to chain transition effects together, load scenes in between transitions
- unhappy with SceneManager registry, how else can it be done (seems hard)
- need animatable button, or at least click effects (probably simpler)
- settings spritsheet needs to be separated into parts

KNOWN BUGS

- switching between clicker and settings can stack scenes
