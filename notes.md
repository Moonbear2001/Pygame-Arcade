gaols:

- ability to chain transition effects together, load scenes in between transitions
- unhappy with SceneManager registry, how else can it be done (seems hard)

- text render uilities should just return a surface (avoid rendering frame after frame)


KNOWN BUGS

- switching between clicker and settings can stack scenes


CURRENTLY WORKING ON

- save load manager needs to be much more versatile
